# Seeing The World and showcasing it

*Published on January 15, 2024*

Like many grads in this tricky market, I was met with a very repetitive question on the day of my graduation:
**What next?**

I hated that question. It made me feel like I was being unproductive or left behind. Like many others that day, I had no clue what I was going to do next. I knew what I wanted to do, but how was I going to get there?

Getting a job was the obvious option, but it was something I felt I might always regret. After 17 years in the education system, I felt I needed some time to reflect and explore. I didn’t want to be sat at a desk learning like I had been for so many years before. I wanted to move.
It’s a common path for many grads. Now, after finishing my travels, I think I’m ready to get that grown-up job. I like to reflect and look back, to tell my stories and give people a glimpse of the experiences I had while travelling through so many different cultures and across so many landscapes.
I suppose that’s why I’m writing here today: to showcase some of the things I got up to. So take a read.

“If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: #848c9d;">Open your mind, get up off the couch, move.</p>”

## Destination Unknown

I was always fascinated with Australia. I wanted to understand their laid-back lifestyle, the beauty of the work-life balance, and the freedom to work a 9 to 5 in the city, then retreat to the beach for a BBQ and a beer. That was my big trip. **I had to go**.

The slight issue was that it’s not exactly recommended for someone who has just spent three years as a student to travel to the other side of the world on such a tight budget.

But I couldn’t just sit still in the meantime, between raising funds and finishing uni. So I turned to the continent.

### European Escapades

Europe has always been a go-to for cheap holidays and quick escapes from the UK because of its close proximity. But there was so much more about the continent that I wanted to learn and experience.

After a few short trips with friends during my three years at university, I became deeply interested in solo travel. I wanted to explore Europe by pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I enjoy new experiences, meeting people, and building relationships with individuals from all kinds of backgrounds.

This mindset goes back to my childhood. My parents always told me to become friends with everyone I possibly can. That advice stayed with me, and it is why, if I ever find myself stranded in the middle of Hamburg, I know I can call on that friend I met in Prague on a night out, that I ended up spending the next three days with and learning everything there is to know about eachother.

I think the beauty of being alone in such a big place is that all it takes is one conversation with someone at the hostel bar, and suddenly, you are no longer alone. So are you ever truly alone? I would argue no. Although I felt alone in many places on my trip to Europe, a lot of that was by choice. It was an escape from constant conversation, perhaps, but for me, one of the biggest lessons I learned was that no one truly cares.

People everywhere are focused on their own lives. They live their own way. They do not care if you are walking by yourself at a beer festival or eating alone at a pizza place in one of the most romantic getaways in Eastern Europe. And if they do care, then they are likely dealing with issues bigger than you.

My time in Europe was amazing. I would not say I found myself, because I have never really believed I was lost. I stay true to my values and to what I know. But I definitely opened my eyes to the importance of sticking with something, even when the process feels impossible. You are always just one step away from realising it was all worth it.

That is something I carry with me today in this challenging job market. It is something I carry with me when I am learning a new skill or meeting new people. And it is something I know will stay with me for life.



In future posts, I'll cover topics like:

1. **Web Development** - Tips, tricks, and tutorials
2. **Personal Projects** - Behind-the-scenes looks at my work
3. **Learning Resources** - Books, courses, and tools I recommend

// Here's a code example
function greetReader() {
  console.log("Thanks for reading my blog!");
}
