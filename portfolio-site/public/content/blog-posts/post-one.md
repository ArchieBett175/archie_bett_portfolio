# Seeing The World and showcasing it

*Published on July 28, 2025*

Like many grads in this tricky market, I was met with a very repetitive question on the day of my graduation:
**What next?**

I hated that question. It made me feel like I was being unproductive or left behind. Like many others that day, I had no clue what I was going to do next. I knew what I wanted to do, but how was I going to get there?

Getting a job was the obvious option, but it was something I felt I might always regret. After 17 years in the education system, I felt I needed some time to reflect and explore. I didn’t want to be sat at a desk learning like I had been for so many years before. I wanted to move.
It’s a common path for many grads. Now, after finishing my travels, I think I’m ready to get that grown-up job. I like to reflect and look back, to tell my stories and give people a glimpse of the experiences I had while travelling through so many different cultures and across so many landscapes.
I suppose that’s why I’m writing here today: to showcase some of the things I got up to. So take a read.

“If I'm an advocate for anything, it's to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. The extent to which you can walk in someone else's shoes or at least eat their food, it's a plus for everybody.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: #848c9d;">Open your mind, get up off the couch, move.</p>”

## Destination Unknown

I was always fascinated with Australia. I wanted to understand their laid-back lifestyle, the beauty of the work-life balance, and the freedom to work a 9 to 5 in the city, then retreat to the beach for a BBQ and a beer. That was my big trip. **I had to go**.

The slight issue was that it’s not exactly recommended for someone who has just spent three years as a student to travel to the other side of the world on such a tight budget.

But I couldn’t just sit still in the meantime, between raising funds and finishing uni. So I turned to the continent.

### European Escapades

Europe has always been a go-to for cheap holidays and quick escapes from the UK because of its close proximity. But there was so much more about the continent that I wanted to learn and experience.

After a few short trips with friends during my three years at university, I became deeply interested in solo travel. I wanted to explore Europe by pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I enjoy new experiences, meeting people, and building relationships with individuals from all kinds of backgrounds.

This mindset goes back to my childhood. My parents always told me to become friends with everyone I possibly can. That advice stayed with me, and it is why, if I ever find myself stranded in the middle of Hamburg, I know I can call on that friend I met in Prague on a night out, that I ended up spending the next three days with and learning everything there is to know about eachother.

I think the beauty of being alone in such a big place is that all it takes is one conversation with someone at the hostel bar, and suddenly, you are no longer alone. So are you ever truly alone? I would argue no. Although I felt alone in many places on my trip to Europe, a lot of that was by choice. It was an escape from constant conversation, perhaps, but for me, one of the biggest lessons I learned was that no one truly cares.

People everywhere are focused on their own lives. They live their own way. They do not care if you are walking by yourself at a beer festival or eating alone at a pizza place in one of the most romantic getaways in Eastern Europe. And if they do care, then they are likely dealing with issues bigger than you.

My time in Europe was amazing. I would not say I found myself, because I have never really believed I was lost. I stay true to my values and to what I know. But I definitely opened my eyes to the importance of sticking with something, even when the process feels impossible. You are always just one step away from realising it was all worth it.

That is something I carry with me today in this challenging job market. It is something I carry with me when I am learning a new skill or meeting new people. And it is something I know will stay with me for life.

### The other side of the world

After months of saving and waiting, I finally boarded my first 13-hour China Eastern flight from London Heathrow to Shanghai Pudong Airport. After a short layover and another 11-hour flight, I landed in Sydney. I had completely lost track of what day it was. I left on a Tuesday and arrived on a Thursday, missing an entire day of my life.

At the arrivals gate, I met up with my girlfriend after eight months apart. In that moment, everything made sense. I found my purpose. Everything I had done over the last eight months—the gruelling hours, driving through the rain and dark—I had finally reached my "it was all worth it" moment. It felt similar to the day I graduated.

What followed were two months of living a life that had only ever existed in my imagination while I sat 17,000 kilometers away in the comfort of my own home. I had pushed myself once again beyond my comfort zone. I left behind everything familiar to pursue a dream I had been holding on to since I was a child.

From travelling and campervanning around the South Island of New Zealand to jumping out of a plane from 15,000 feet, I had achieved so much on that trip. Coming back felt like more of a shock and a moment of realisation than when I returned from Europe.

Sometimes I sit and reflect on how much I miss it. The relaxed attitude, the sense of freedom, and maybe most of all, the escapism. I love my family deeply, as most do, but there is something about being so far away—not just in distance, but in time—that makes you truly appreciate those phone calls and FaceTimes.

These moments made me realise something important. The harsh reality is that no one else will ever have the same epic experience that I had at the start of this year. And that got me thinking.

### Showcasing Memories

I like to think a lot about how anyone's life could be a movie if they had a camera crew and a producer following them around. So why not make your own movie? Show the parts you want to show. Everyone enjoys a bit of attention in one way or another. People love the questions, the curiosity, the interest in their lives.

Having always been passionate about content creation and making videos for others to enjoy, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to create something I could be proud of. A way to look back and show the world how I experienced my three months in Australia.

Please take the time to watch the video below and let me know what you think. Thank you so much for reading this. It is something I have wanted to share for a while but never had the right outlet for.
