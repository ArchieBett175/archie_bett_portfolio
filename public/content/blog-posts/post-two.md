# The Lifecycle after Graduating from tech

Graduating could be seen as my life’s work up to this point. I spent 17 years in the education system, learning from some of the most influential people in my life. In the end, receiving a degree and a "free" glass of cheap prosecco felt completely worth it.

Looking back, my time in school, university, and everything in between were some of the best years of my life. Now, a year out of university, I reflect with a sense of envy. It almost feels like I didn’t appreciate those moments enough. Like I took them for granted.

I have always loved learning. It satisfies something deep within me, the constant desire to improve and become better. That is probably why I enjoyed school as much as I did. But after graduating and finishing my travels, I felt somewhat lost. I was searching for what came next. Naturally, that meant finding full-time work, but I knew I wanted that work to be in tech.

Technology has been a passion of mine since I first got my hands on a computer as a child. Growing up in such a digital age, it is hard not to be shaped by it. I think that is why I feel so strongly about it. The desire to help people and improve everyday life through digital solutions has always stayed with me.

I was never drawn to healthcare or motivated enough by science to help people in that way. But with tech, whether it is software or hardware, it just made sense to me. I understood how it worked, and I became fascinated with the process of designing systems that could change behaviours and solve real-world problems. That, I believe, is where my drive truly comes from.

## 2nd class honours

I came out of university with a strong background in solutions development. I loved the process of taking a problem and watching my idea come to life, ready for submission and real use. However, I often feel that I am held back in today’s highly competitive job market because of my degree title.

With a name more suited to communication, Interactive Media does not immediately stand out in a crowd of Computer Science and Software Engineering graduates. In some ways, that is understandable. My degree was more design-oriented, and I focused more on understanding the technologies than the underlying theoretical concepts.

That said, I know how to develop. I understand product lifecycles and the stages of software development. Yet when you do not make it past the initial AI screening, it can be demoralising. It makes you question whether the time, effort, and financial investment were truly worth it.

### Application Battle

This is where I reflect on a struggle that many new graduates in this industry face. A few years ago, if you told someone you were studying something tech-related, they would respond with confidence. You were set for life. A lot of us believed that too.

It was not until we left education that many of us realised we were missing key skills. Skills that were never taught in a second-year computational thinking module. The reality is that the job market is tough, and companies can be incredibly cutthroat. Most will not even send you a rejection email. Instead, they disappear, leaving you wondering what you did wrong.

But in truth, it is hard to blame them. These companies receive hundreds of applications from equally qualified, equally ambitious engineers every single day. What separates us often comes down to the smallest details.

This makes me think the industry needs to ask itself an important question. Can this process be improved? Is it possible for companies to be more empathetic in their hiring practices while still remaining competitive?

## Conclusion

This is more of a rant and a reflection than anything else. I just think the job market is already tough enough, and sometimes I feel companies should cut candidates some slack if they do not know every detail about the business or who their clients are.

If you are in the same boat as me and currently looking for work, my advice is to stick with it. Every "no" brings you one step closer to a "yes." Learn from every experience. Every awkward interview moment, every difficult question, every pause and stumble. Take the feedback. It will not only make you a better candidate, but it will also help you grow as a person.

And if you did not get that job, especially one in recruitment or tech, it does not mean you are a failure. It means the system failed to support you. That rejection is just a sign that something better is on the way.

Thank you for reading.
