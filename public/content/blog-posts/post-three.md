# My Journey in creating digital media

_Published July 28, 2025_

Naturally, when my university football team needed a Social Media Manager, they turned to me—the guy studying an Interactive Media degree, often jokingly called the “Social Media Degree” by team members. With my experience in creating digital graphics, I was excited to take on the challenge of managing the team’s social media channels alongside my studies.

When I was in secondary school, I was absolutely obsessed with YouTube and wanted to become a YouTuber when I was older. I created my own channel and named it Galicate, inspired by my favourite YouTuber, Syndicate, and my love for Galaxy chocolate bars. It made perfect sense in my head.

I watched countless videos on how to become a successful YouTuber. One in particular emphasized the importance of creating eye-catching graphics and thumbnails. That is where my digital media journey began.

</div>

You could definitely argue that my style got worse, but I was learning. I felt my videos became more engaging. Maybe I was wrong, but that was how it felt at the time. I was learning the basics using an open-source software called GIMP, which allowed me to experiment with these tools in a free and cost-effective way.

My YouTube climb to stardom faded as I reached the end of my school years—in other words, it completely died off. Now it’s just something I mention at parties while showing people the videos. But my passion for creating good-looking things never went away. I have always noticed the little details when visiting websites or seeing marketing campaigns, and to this day, I believe I could do a better job.

In my first year of university, I took a module called Introduction to Media Technologies. It gave me a complete overview of the entire Adobe Suite and reignited my passion for creating digital work in my spare time. I continued to use Photoshop and other software to create digital pieces for my projects, and I also began designing graphics for my university football team.

## Becoming a Social Media Manager

I took on much more than just designing Instagram graphics when I became a social media manager. The role taught me about planning and running campaigns to maximise reach and user engagement.

One standout period was when we took on the Yorkshire Three Peaks for charity. Raising money through the team’s social media extended beyond my own reach, as I created pages and resources for team members to share with their family and friends. We raised over £1400 in just a couple of weeks and organised 20 team members to complete the challenge, which was just one part of the overall effort.

My day-to-day responsibilities included keeping up with match results and upcoming fixtures to ensure that club members and the wider community stayed informed and connected with the club’s activities. This was especially busy during the football season, particularly in November, when the entire club took part in charity runs and fundraising efforts for Movember.

## Conclusion

This journey has taught me a lot about what looks good and what doesn’t, but also what works and what doesn’t. I like to think carefully about how a user will interact with something I design, and I pay close attention to the little details that can influence how a feature makes someone feel.

I’m grateful for everything I’ve learned about the creative process. If you’re interested in seeing more examples of my design work or other digital media projects, check out the “Explore All” section in the Projects tab. And as always, thanks for reading and following along!
